# WinConsole

The script:

1. Notices you to install a specific font, and sets it as a console font;
2. Removes all current console settings and sets the default as that to Geeâ€™s preference.

You should **NOT** use this script directly (you need to tweak it) unless you use Chinese in Windows console. You have to acquire `YaHei Consolas Hybrid` font yourself.
